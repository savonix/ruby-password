0.15.4
------

Trying to make compatible with 1.9.1. - Albert

0.5.3
-----

No functional changes. The build no longer tries to use packer.h if available.
crack.h will always be sought and used.


0.5.2
-----

No functional changes. The build environment was modified to search for the
system dictionary in the additional location of
/var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict.pwd, which is where it is on Debian Linux.


0.5.1
-----

Password.get would throw an exception in the unlikely event that STDIN reached
EOF without any input. Thanks to Will Drewry <wad@google.com> for pointing
this out.

pwgen now supports a -v or --version switch.


0.5.0
-----

This is a major update. The user-visible changes between this version and the
previous, 0.4.1, are as follows:

A new example program, pwgen, has been added, complete with man page. Ted
Ts'o's C program of the same name inspired this Ruby version. The man page is
also adapted from his.

A new class method, Password.phonemic, generates phonemic passwords. This,
too, was inspired by Ted Ts'o's work on pwgen. As its second parameter, it can
take zero or more new constants, logically OR'ed together. Available constants
are Password::ONE_DIGIT and Password::ONE_CASE. The former specifies that the
generated password should contain at least one digit, whilst the latter
specifies that the password should contain at least one capital letter.

The old Password.random method has been renamed Password.urandom and replaced
by a new Password.random that does not depend on /dev/urandom, making it much
more portable. Password.urandom will return nil on platforms that do not
implement the /dev/urandom device.

Password.get will now detect whether STDIN is connected to a tty. If not, no
password prompt is displayed and no attempt will be made to manipulate
terminal echo.

The prompt parameter to Password.get and Password.getc must now be passed in
its entirety. Previously, the string ': ' would be automatically appended to
the user-supplied prompt, but this behaviour has been changed in order to
accommodate null prompts. The default string for the prompt parameter has been
changed accordingly.

Running password.rb directly will now result in a call to Password.phonemic
and the display of the resulting password.

The Password::BadDictionary exception has been renamed
Password::DictionaryError and made a subclass of StandardError instead of
RuntimeError.

The CryptError exception has been moved to Password::CryptError and is now a
subclass of StandardError instead of RuntimeError.

A new constant, PASSWD_CHARS, gives the list of characters from which
automatically generated passwords will be chosen. Note that Password.urandom
will use the additional characters '+' and '/'.

A new constant, SALT_CHARS, gives the list of characters valid as salt
characters when invoking Password#crypt.

Password.getc now returns an instance of Password, not String.

Password.random now returns a Password, not a String.

A Password::CryptError exception is now raised if the salt passed to
Password#crypt contains a bad character.

RDoc documentation has been added. The INSTALL file explains how to build it.

The RD documentation has been removed in favour of the RDoc documentation.


0.4.1
-----

Use of the rb_enable_super() function caused a warning in Ruby 1.8.x. This
has now been fixed.


0.4.0
-----

When a bad dictionary path is provided to Password#check, a
Password::BadDictionary exception is now raised.

Turn off Ruby buffering for Password.getc, as this resulted in the prompt not
being displayed when called by Ruby 1.8.


0.3.0
-----

The Crack class is gone and Password is now a direct subclass of String.  If
you were previously creating Crack objects and calling their methods, you can
now no longer do this (and there really never was a good reason to do that,
anyway).

As a result of this change, Password#check now raises a Password::WeakPassword
exception if the password is weak, not a Crack::WeakPassword exception.


0.2.1
-----

No new features. The only changes are portability enhancements to the build
system.


0.2.0
-----

Password#check no longer returns an empty string on success and a string
describing the nature of the password weakness on failure.

Instead, it returns true on success and raises a Crack::WeakPassword exception
on failure.


0.1.1
-----

Password.get now returns an instance of Password, not String.
Password.new now defaults to assigning a null string.
